In documentarylike interviews, the East Texas locals (a mix of real Carthage folk and Texas actors) fill the film from start to finish: a gang of colorful gossips whose heavy accents and wry prattle essentially narrate the story. What drives their fascination is the true-life tale of a mannered, devout mortician, Bernie Tiede (Jack Black), who in 1997 was arrested for killing the elderly millionaire heiress Marjorie Nugent (a bitter, hardened Shirley MacLaine). The remarkable thing about the case is just how out of character such an act is for Tiede. As Black plays him, he's cartoonishly cheerful — not just a churchgoing man, but a member of the choir and just about every other community group. The film never quite rises to full comedy, but remains locked in a state of satirical curiosity, marveling at its own contradictions. Black, who memorably starred in Linklater's \"School of Rock,\" never gives in to a punch line, but his grand, absurdist performance is closer to parody than realism. He has a number of musical moments, including belting out \"Seventy-Six Trombones\" in full regalia. This is Linklater's Preston Sturges comedy, an ode to small-town Texas life, where civil society is prized so much as to outweigh a little ol' thing like murder. With an excellent Matthew McConaughey as a self-promoting district attorney. PG-13 for some violent images and brief strong language. 104 minutes.
